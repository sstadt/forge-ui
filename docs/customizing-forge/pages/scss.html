<p>Forge comes with a compiled and minified CSS file in the dist folder for prototyping and quick starts. For more customization of the styling, each Vue and CSS component comes with a host of SCSS variables that can be configured to taste for each app.</p>
<p>Each variable is declared as a default, so overriding these values is easy. First, though, you'll need to set up your main SCSS file with a settings import and Forge import.</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
/* /scss/style.css */

@import "_settings";
@import "forge-ui";

/* ... */
</pre></code>

<p>At this point, customization is as easy as finding the component in the documentation you wish to modify, and copying the variable name into _settings.scss.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to change the body background color to an off-white color we could add the following to _settings.scss:</p>

<pre><code class="language-css">
/* /scss/_settings.scss */

$body-background: #fefefe;

/* ... */
</pre></code>
